# WeatherApp
A simple weather app that asks for your location and give you the temperature in that location.
NOTE: Don't forget to download the <i>skycons</i> repository into the <i>WeatherApp</i> repository, else the icons won't work.

Further updates include:
<ul>
  <li>Buttons with different weather reports.</li>
  <li>Dark mode (I love dark modes).</li>
  <li>Daily reports with graphs.</li>
</ul>
