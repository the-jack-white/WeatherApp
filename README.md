# WeatherApp
A simple weather app that asks for your location and give you the temperature in that location.
<br>
NOTE: Don't forget to download the <i>skycons</i> repository, extract the zip and add the <i>skycons.js</i> file to your project directory, else the weather icons won't work.

Further updates include:
<ul>
  <li>Buttons with different weather reports.</li>
  <li>Dark mode (I love dark modes).</li>
  <li>Daily reports with graphs.</li>
</ul>
